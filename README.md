# err-gitbot a plugin that watches your git repositories.

For more information about err you can find it here: https://github.com/errbotio/errbot

## Installation

### dependencies

```bash
pip install gitpython
```

If you have the admin rights on an err chatbot simply use:

```
!repos install errbotio/err-gitbot
```

in order to install the plugin.
Then !help to see the available commands and their explanation.

Some tips here :

To track all the branches of a repo just say with the repo url:

```
!git follow git://github.com/opdenkamp/xbmc.git
```

Err will extract smartly the name "xbmc" from it.

if you want to follow a specific branches instead of everything just:

```
!git follow git://github.com/opdenkamp/xbmc.git Eden-pvr Dharma
```

If you redo a follow this time simply with the symbolic name you can add new branches to track:

```
!git follow xbmc staging
```

Or you can remove a specific branch with `!git unfollow`:

```
!git unfollow xbmc staging
```

Or the repo alltogether

```
!git unfollow xbmc 
```

If at any point you are lost, you can ask the list of currently followed repos / branches with:
```
!git following
```
Note : If you have several chatrooms defined in your err config, it will only "spam" the first one.
